/**
 * `{param}` extraction/rewriting for declared route paths — a single forward character scan, with NO
 * regular expression, so the work is strictly linear in the input length for EVERY input (no
 * backtracking, no quantifier, and no length cap on the param name).
 *
 * The two helpers are the shared, byte-exact equivalent of iterating the pattern `\{([^}/]+)\}`
 * globally over a path — the form the route/view emitters and the Hono-path rewrite historically used.
 * They preserve that pattern's EXACT semantics for every input, including its edges:
 *   - `{}`        → NOT a param (the run needs at least one character);
 *   - `{a/b}`     → NOT a param (a `/` ends the run before a `}` can close it);
 *   - `{a}{b}`    → two params (`a`, `b`);
 *   - `{a{b}`     → one param whose name is `a{b` (an inner `{` is an ordinary name character);
 *   - `{unclosed` → no param (no closing `}`);
 *   - names of ANY length (1, 128, 129, thousands) and ANY code points (ASCII, emoji, astral).
 *
 * A `{param}` here is `{`, then a maximal run of ≥1 characters that are neither `}` nor `/`, then a
 * `}`. Because the run stops at the first `}` or `/`, a match exists at a `{` iff that first stopping
 * character is a `}` (a `/` or end-of-input means no match at this `{`); on a non-match the scan
 * advances by a single character, exactly as a global regex retries at the next position.

 * extract and rewrite paths can never drift.
