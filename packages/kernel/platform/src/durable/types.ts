/**
 * The NEUTRAL durable-execution seam — engine-agnostic.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS LIVES HERE (and carries NO engine reference).
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This adds an ORCHESTRATOR above the run-journal + `run_events`: it changes only WHERE
 * `runAgent` runs (a durable worker vs the HTTP request), not how events persist or stream. The
 * concrete engine (DBOS) lives in its OWN package `@rayspec/durable-dbos`; this neutral
 * interface is what the api-auth run surface depends on, so `@rayspec/platform` / `run-core` / the
 * three adapters stay completely DBOS-free. The engine asymmetry (DBOS's `WorkflowStatus`, queues,
 * recovery semantics) is absorbed INSIDE the adapter, never leaked into these neutral types — the
 * the anti-LCD-collapse discipline applied to the off-request spine.
 *
 * The `RunJob` payload is a plain JSON-serializable bag sufficient to RECONSTRUCT an off-request run
 * (the durable engine persists it; on recovery it re-hydrates from this, not from in-memory state).
 * It deliberately carries NO `Backend`/`AgentSpec`/`TenantDb` handle — those are RESOLVED inside the
 * worker from `job.agentId` + `job.tenantId` (so a serialized job has no live object graph). The
 * engine adapter is constructed with a resolver (`{ db, resolveRun }`) that turns a `RunJob` back
 * into `{ backend, spec, tools }` at fire time.
 */

/**

 * every field must be a plain JSON value. The `runId` is PRE-MINTED + idempotency-reserved by the
 * HTTP run surface BEFORE enqueue (reserve-before-execute), and the engine uses it as the durable
 * workflow id, so DBOS's own workflow-id idempotency law and our `idempotency_keys` reservation
 * interlock to exactly one job per Idempotency-Key.
