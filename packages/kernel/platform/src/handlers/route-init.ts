/**
 * Route + trigger handler invocation (the transaction boundary).
 *
 * A ROUTE/TRIGGER handler — UNLIKE a tool handler — runs INSIDE a `TenantDb.transaction()` (the
 * `app.current_tenant` GUC seam, external-exposure-ready), because it is a single coarse unit of work,
 * not one of several parallel tool calls under the dispatch Semaphore. So these builders:
 *   1. open `tdb.transaction(...)` (populating the GUC),
 *   2. build the `HandlerInit` whose `HandlerDb` is bound to the TRANSACTIONAL TenantDb (so every DB
 *      touch the handler makes is in that one tenant-scoped tx — read+write atomic), and
 *   3. invoke the handler through the SINGLE `HandlerRuntime` indirection (the swappable isolate seam).
 *
 * The route handler's return value is the response body (the api interpreter serializes it as JSON).
 * The trigger handler returns void (parse/register-only — this is the contract the durable worker uses;
 * a synchronous past-bound trigger fire is fail-closed-rejected at the api/worker edge, not here).
 *
 * TRUSTED-AUTHOR: as everywhere in this model, the in-process handler can still reach ambient Node
 * globals; the transaction/GUC scoping is the DB-capability seam, real confinement is the external-exposure isolate.

/**
 * Invoke a declared ROUTE handler WITHOUT the engine-opened route transaction (the

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (the intake-ordering law): a conversational turn route must (1) COMMIT its
 * intake before a model runs, (2) hold NO transaction across the in-request `runAgent` (which
 * journals/persists incrementally on its own connection — run-core.ts documents that the sync HTTP
 * path runs OUTSIDE any transaction; the `{agent}` route arm has the same deliberate posture), and
 * (3) persist the reply in its OWN short write. A single engine-held tx around the whole handler
 * makes all three impossible — so this variant builds the SAME init (one shared builder above,
 * trust-boundary brand strip included) over the BASE TenantDb and lets the handler manage its own short
 * transactions via `init.db.transaction(...)` (each a REAL top-level tx — the store facade's
 * existing tool-handler posture, applied to a route handler).
 *
 * ⚠ RLS-READINESS (honest): statements a handler issues OUTSIDE an explicit `db.transaction(...)`
 * do not populate the `app.current_tenant` GUC (only `TenantDb.transaction` sets it). That is the
 * SAME class as the existing sync run surface (`executeAgentRun` runs `runAgent` on a base
 * TenantDb); the tenant predicate stays STRUCTURAL either way. A handler on this posture should do
 * its writes inside explicit transactions — the conversation binding does.

 * Invoke a declared `stream` ROUTE handler (mode:'ingest') inside a tenant transaction. UNLIKE

 * body — the api interpreter passed `c.req.raw`, NEVER `c.req.json()`) and returns a raw Web
 * `Response`; this builder wires the tenant-bound capabilities and returns that `Response` verbatim
 * (the api interpreter hands it straight back to Hono — no JSON envelope).
 *
 * The handler runs INSIDE `tdb.transaction(...)` (the `app.current_tenant` GUC seam) so every
 * `init.db` write (the pointer row) is in ONE tenant-scoped, atomic transaction. `init.blob` is the
 * tenant-bound `BlobStore`, built per request via `blobFactory(txTdb.tenantId)` so the handle is
 * bound to the run's SERVER-DERIVED tenant (never a handler-supplied value) — its keys are
 * tenant-prefixed by construction (the blob does NOT traverse the SQL chokepoint, so that prefix +
 * the path jail are its ENTIRE tenant isolation). The transaction COMMITS iff the handler returns
 * (resolves); a thrown handler rolls the pointer-row write back (the blob put-by-index is idempotent,
 * so a retry re-puts the same bytes safely — the pointer UNIQUE is the idempotency authority).
 *
 * The `blobFactory` is REQUIRED here (a stream handler exists to move bytes): the api interpreter
 * fail-closes the BOOT if a `stream` route is declared without a blob backend wired, so by the time
 * this is called `blobFactory` is always present — it is a required param, not optional like
 * `invokeRouteHandler`'s.
 *
 * ⚠ EXTERNAL-EXPOSURE ISOLATE-READINESS (honest — the SAME caveat class as `HandlerDb.transaction`'s closure):
 * the rest of the handler model is SERIALIZABLE-shaped (name-keyed db calls + plain rows + opaque
 * blob keys) so an in-process call becomes a cross-isolate call under the isolate seam with no handler change. The
 * raw Web `Request`/`Response` a STREAM handler exchanges, however, is NOT trivially serializable
 * across an isolate boundary (a `Request`/`Response` carries a live body stream + header object, not
 * a plain value). So — like `HandlerDb.transaction`'s closure — the cross-isolate STREAM model is an
 * isolate DESIGN POINT (an explicit byte-channel + a header/status envelope protocol), NOT something this
 * seam already solves. For exactly that reason a stream handler is invoked DIRECTLY here, NOT through
 * the `HandlerRuntime` indirection (whose `invokeRoute`/`invokeTool`/`invokeTrigger` are the
 * serializable-shaped surfaces the isolate marshals): adding an `invokeStream(Request)→Response`
 * to that interface would falsely imply the raw-Request/Response path is already isolate-ready. The
 * in-process call is correct + GUC-populated; do NOT claim the stream path is isolate-ready.
