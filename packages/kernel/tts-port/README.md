# @rayspec/tts-port

The provider-neutral text-to-speech port: the `TtsAdapter` contract and its request/result
types, the shared request-normalization rules (text cap, voice membership, speed clamp)
every adapter behind the port applies, and a deterministic fake adapter for tests. Concrete
providers (e.g. `@rayspec/adapter-openai-tts`) depend on this port.

Part of [RaySpec](https://rayspec.dev) — **file-deployable AI infrastructure**: describe a
product's backend in one declarative YAML file, and RaySpec stands up accounts and
authentication, in-process agents, an HTTP API, a Postgres-backed data layer, durable
background jobs, and the supporting tooling — deployed GitOps-style from that single file.

Most projects consume this package indirectly — start with
[`npx rayspec init`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rayspec) or `@rayspec/server` rather
than depending on it directly.
